# better-git-blame
a lazy nvim plugin created to add more functionality to a git blame by gathering all commits that changed the selected lines and allowing the user to see the diff of those commits
</br></br>
takes a heuristic approach where it searches for git commits with changes inbetween the selected lines so really only useful for a shorter history of the code you selected
</br></br>
made this for myself so excuse the code </br>
feel free to use if you want to and can figure out how to add it on your own
</br>
